Rainfall and Spurious Sensor Readings

The rain counter occasionally reports incorrect rainfall.  On some stations,
the counter decrements then increments.  Or the counter may increase by more
than the number of bucket tips that actually occurred.  The max_rain_rate
helps filter these bogus readings.  This filter is applied to any sample
period.  If the volume of the samples in the period divided by the sample
period interval are greater than the maximum rain rate, the samples are
ignored.

Spurious rain counter decrements often accompany what appear to be noisy
sensor readings.  So if we detect a spurious rain counter decrement, we ignore
the rest of the sensor data as well.  The suspect sensor readings appear
despite the double reading (to ensure the read is not happening mid-write)
and do not seem to correlate to unstable reads.

A single bucket tip is equivalent to 0.3 mm of rain.  The default maximum
rate is 24 cm/hr (9.44 in/hr).  For a sample period of 5 minutes this would
be 2 cm (0.78 in) or about 66 bucket tips, or one tip every 4 seconds.  For
a sample period of 30 minutes this would be 12 cm (4.72 in)

The rain counter is two bytes, so the maximum value is 0xffff or 65535.  This
translates to 19660.5 mm of rainfall (19.66 m or 64.9 ft).  The console would
have to run for two years with 2 inches of rainfall a day before the counter
wraps around.
MJW: Serial reading gives mm reading directly

Pressure Calculations

Pressures are calculated and reported differently by pywws and wview.  These
are the variables:

 - abs_pressure - the raw sensor reading
 - fixed_block_rel_pressure - value entered in console, then follows
     abs_pressure as it changes
 - fixed_block_abs_pressure - seems to follow abs_pressure, sometimes
     with a lag of a minute or two
 - pressure - station pressure (SP) - adjusted raw sensor reading
 - barometer - sea level pressure derived from SP using temperaure and altitude
 - altimeter - sea level pressure derived from SP using altitude

wview reports the following:

  pressure = abs_pressure * calMPressure + calCPressure
  barometer = sp2bp(pressure, altitude, temperature)
  altimeter = sp2ap(pressure, altitude)

pywws reports the following:

  pressure = abs_pressure + pressure_offset

where pressure_offset is

  pressure_offset = fixed_block_relative_pressure - fixed_block_abs_pressure

so that

  pressure = fixed_block_relative_pressure

pywws does not do barometer or altimeter calculations.

this implementation does the following:

  pressure = abs_pressure + offset
  barometer = sp2bp(adjp, altitude, temperature)
  altimeter = sp2ap(adjp, altitude)

where 'offset' is specified in weewx.conf (default is 0), 'altitude' is
specified in weewx.conf, and 'temperature' is read from the sensors.

The 'barometer' value is reported to wunderground, cwop, etc.
